# This is an internship task for omniflo.

## Stack Used : MERN

### Desscription

The code is sperated into 2 parts, Client and Server. As name suggest client is react code and server is the "Server".

To start server :

-   Open the server folder into terminal.
-   Use `npm i` to install dependencies.
-   Use `npm start` to run the code.
-   Note: Code uses `nodmeon index.js` as start script and on some machines nodemon doesn't work with global install so either use `node index.js` or install nodemon globally using `npm i nodemonn -g`

To start client :

-   Open the client folder into terminal.
-   Use `npm i` to install dependencies.
-   As this is just small project i am not using `react build` so you have to use `npm start` to start the server.
-   React will start on port 8000;

Some checks :

-   Server is started on port 3000, so got to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and check if you get a messgae saying not found to make sure server is started
-   I am not using any env variables to save both of us from setting them at first place.

Can it be improved :

-   Ofcourse it can, this is a very basic code to show-off my skills. For production build we will add multiple small things like giving better notification for tasks or running react build instead of devlopment build etc.
